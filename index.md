# Welcome to Jade Levandofsky's Designer Manifesto

This manifesto was made as part of the final project for Dr. Leah Lievrouw's UCLA IS272 Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course taught Spring 2022.
This project is inspired by IS272 course readings as well as Lynn Boyden's IS279 User Experience Design Winter 2022 course. Especially helpful for this assignment, and to familarize audiences reading, was the piece by Richard Buchanan, **(1985). Declaration by design: Rhetoric, argument and demonstration in design 
practice. Design Issues, 2(1), Spring 1985 , pp.4-22.**

### How to read this designer manifesto

This Manifesto is meant to read in a cyclical order as each point references the next in order 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4...and so on!

## Design As You Teach
Design should be instructional. Every element of design should impart some aspect of instruction, or a lesson. This teaching moment is always relative to what you are trying to critique and convey to your audience and how you perceive them. Ranging from an intuitive and simple design that is easy for anyone to understand, to a complex concept that might require background knowledge, the middle of this spectrum exists the potential for intentional confusion, yet this should be purposeful.

## Design Is Purposeful
Just as many institutions and organizations have a mission and vision statement, so too should your designs. Every designer has a positionality and thus their intent may not be the same as their impact but it still stands that every designer has an intent when designing and this cannot be ignored.

## Design Is Not Neutral
Behind every design is a designer and with that an intent. As every designer has a positionality, their design reflects this whether they intended it to or not. Every designer has implicit bias, thinking along an axis of identities. Even if a design is intended to be without a purpose, in effect, its purpose becomes its lack of one.

## Design Is Not Static
Design does not exist within a vacuum, just as the designer has a positionality so too does the design itself. Whether or not a design exists within a canon or outside a school of practice, its value is attenuated towards its surrounding context and relations of other practices, past, ongoing, future. It is important to keep this in mind when forming critique and creating new designs as this goes back to the first point.
