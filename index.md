## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jlevando/DesignerManifesto2022/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

This Manifesto is meant to read in a cyclical order as each point references the next in order 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4...and so on!
# Design As You Teach
Design should be instructional. Every element of design should impart some aspect of instruction, or a lesson. This teaching moment is always relative to what you are trying to critique and convey to your audience and how you perceive them. Ranging from an intuitive and simple design that is easy for anyone to understand, to a complex concept that might require background knowledge, the middle of this spectrum exists the potential for intentional confusion, yet this should be purposeful.

## Design Is Purposeful
Just as many institutions and organizations have a mission and vision statement, so too should your designs. Every designer has a positionality and thus their intent may not be the same as their impact but it still stands that every designer has an intent when designing and this cannot be ignored.

### Design Is Not Neutral
Behind every design is a designer and with that an intent. As every designer has a positionality, their design reflects this whether they intended it to or not. Every designer has implicit bias, thinking along an axis of identities. Even if a design is intended to be without a purpose, in effect, its purpose becomes its lack of one.

#### Design Is Not Static
Design does not exist within a vacuum, just as the designer has a positionality so too does the design itself. Whether or not a design exists within a canon or outside a school of practice, its value is attenuated towards its surrounding context and relations of other practices, past, ongoing, future. It is important to keep this in mind when forming critique and creating new designs as this goes back to the first point.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jlevando/DesignerManifesto2022/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
